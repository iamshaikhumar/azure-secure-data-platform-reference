# Azure Secure Data Platform Reference

This repository documents a reference architecture for designing and operating a
secure, scalable, and governable data platform on Microsoft Azure.

The goal is not to provide a deployable product, but to capture **design patterns,
tradeoffs, and failure modes** that apply to real-world public-sector data systems.

All examples are conceptual and use synthetic or illustrative data only. Real world data, when used, is annotated accordingly.

## Intended audience
- Data engineering leaders and architects
- Platform and reliability engineers
- Security and governance stakeholders
- IT staff from public sector agencies
- Students learning modern data platform design

## Architecture goals
- Security-by-design (identity, network, auditability)
- Clear separation of batch and streaming workloads
- Strong data quality and observability
- Cost-aware scaling
- Operational transparency for incident response

## What this repository contains
- High-level architecture overview
- Component-level design considerations
- Security and threat modeling notes
- Governance and data quality patterns
- GenAI considerations for analytics workloads
